# GEDLIB (1.0)

## 1. About GEDLIB

GEDLIB is a C++ library for (suboptimally) computing edit distances between graphs using various state-of-the-art methods. GEDLIB allows you to build your graphs via the C++ API or load them from [GXL files](http://www.gupro.de/GXL/index.html). Several benchmark datasets are distributed with GEDLIB. For these datasets, GEDLIB provides predefined edit cost functions. You can easily extend GEDLIB by implementing new edit cost functions or new methods for computing the graph edit distance. An extensive Doxygen documentation is availabe [here](https://dbblumenthal.github.io/gedlib/).

## 2. License and Citing

## 3. Installation under Unix

GEDLIB uses the following external libraries:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/), for compilation. For installation instructions, see [https://cmake.org/install/](https://cmake.org/install/). 
- [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/), for creating the documentation. For installation instructions, see [https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/install.html](https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/install.html).
- [OpenMP](http://www.openmp.org/) compatible C++ compiler. Under Linux, OpenMP is supported by default. Under Max OS, please install [libomp](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/libomp) using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).  After installing Homebrew, open a shell and execute `$ brew install libomp`.
- [Gurobi (version 8.01 or higher)](http://www.gurobi.com/), for solving mixed integer and linear programming problems. Gurobi is commercial software, but has a free academic licence. Download the binaries and header files into a directory `<GUROBI_ROOT>` and activate your Gurobi licence as described in the Gurobi documentation. If you cannot obtain a licence for Gurobi, you can install GEDLIB without it. In this case, the methods which use mixed integer or linear programming are not available.
- The following external libraries are distributed with GEDLIB:
    - [Eigen (version 3.3.4)](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
    - [NOMAD (version 3.8)](https://www.gerad.ca/nomad/Project/Home.html)
    - [LSAPE (version 5)](https://bougleux.users.greyc.fr/lsape/)
    - [LIBSVM (version 3.22)](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/)
    - [FANN (version 2.2.0)](http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/)
    - [Boost (version 1.69.0)](https://www.boost.org/). Does not require compilation.


After having installed CMake, Doxygen, OpenMP (under Mac OS), and, possibly, Gurobi, execute the script `install.py` for installing GEDLIB and the external libraries distributed with GEDLIB:

```sh
python install.py [--help] [-h] [--doc] [--tests <arg>] [--gurobi <GUROBI_ROOT>] [--debug] [--clean] [--lib gxl|<indentifier>,<UserNodeID>,<UserNodeLabel>,<UserEdgeLabel>]
```

If you execute `install.py` without any arguments, only the external libraries distributed with GEDLIB are installed.

- `--help`, `-h`: Show help.  
- `--doc`: Build the [Doxygen documentation](https://dbblumenthal.github.io/gedlib/).
- `--tests <arg>`: Build test executables. Use the option  `--help` to display possible values of `<arg>`.
- `--gurobi <GUROBI_ROOT>`: Tell GEDLIB where to find your Gurobi installation.
- `--debug`: Build in debug mode. 
- `--clean`: Delete the build directoy and update the makefile before the build.
- `--lib gxl`: Build the shared library `lib/libgxlgedlib.so` for usage with graphs given in the [GXL file format](http://www.gupro.de/GXL/index.html).
- `--lib <indentifier>,<UserNodeID>,<UserNodeLabel>,<UserEdgeLabel>`: Build the shared library `lib/lib<indentifier>gedlib.so` for graphs with custom node ID, node label, and edge label types. For example, executing `$ python install.py --lib mytypes,int,double,double` builds the shared library `lib/libmytypesgedlib.so` for usage with graphs whose node IDs are of type `int` and whose node and edge labels are of type `double`.

## 4. Building an Application that Uses GEDLIB

### 4.1 Building an Application that Uses GEDLIB as Header-Only Library

For building an application that uses GEDLIB as a header-only library, it suffices to execute the installation script `install.py` without any options. Subsequently, carry out the following steps:

- Add the following directories to your include directories:
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>`
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/ext/boost.1.69.0`
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/ext/eigen.3.3.4/Eigen`
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/ext/nomad.3.8.1/src`
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/ext/nomad.3.8.1/ext/sgtelib/src`
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/ext/lsape.5/include`
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/ext/libsvm.3.22` 
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/ext/fann.2.2.0/include`

    - If you want to install GEDLIB with Gurobi, additionally add the following link directory:
        - Under MacOS: `<GUROBI_ROOT>/mac64/lib`
        - Under Linux: `<GUROBI_ROOT>/linux64/lib`
- Link your application against the following shared libraries:
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/ext/fann.2.2.0/lib/libdoublefann.2.dylib`
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/ext/libsvm.3.22/libsvm.so`
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/ext/nomad.3.8.1/libnomad.so`
    - If you want to install GEDLIB with Gurobi, additionally link your application against the following libraries:
        - Under MacOS: `<GUROBI_ROOT>/mac64/lib/libgurobi80.so` and `<GUROBI_ROOT>/mac64/lib/libgurobi_c++.a`
        - Under Linux: `<GUROBI_ROOT>/linux64/lib/libgurobi80.so` and `<GUROBI_ROOT>/linux64/lib/libgurobi_c++.a`
- If you want to install GEDLIB with Gurobi, define `GUROBI` before including the header `src/env/ged_env.hpp`.

### 4.2 Building an Application that Uses GEDLIB as Shared Library

#### 4.2.1 Graphs Given as GXL Files

If you want to build an application that uses GEDLIB as a shared for graphs given as GXL files, make sure that you have installed GEDLIB with the option `--lib gxl`. Subsequently, carry out the folowing steps:

- Add the following directories to your include directories:
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>`
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/ext/boost.1.69.0`
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/ext/eigen.3.3.4/Eigen`
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/ext/nomad.3.8.1/src`
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/ext/nomad.3.8.1/ext/sgtelib/src`
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/ext/lsape.5/include`
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/ext/libsvm.3.22` 
    - `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/ext/fann.2.2.0/include`
    - If you want to install GEDLIB with Gurobi, additionally add the following include directory:
        - Under MacOS: `<GUROBI_ROOT>/mac64/include`
        - Under Linux: `<GUROBI_ROOT>/linux64/include`
- Add the directory `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/lib` to your link directories.
- Link your application against the shared library `libgxlgedlib.so`.

#### 4.2.2 Graphs with User-Defined Node ID, Node Label, and Edge Label Types

If you want to build an application that uses GEDLIB as a shared library for graphs with custom node ID, node label, and edge label types, make sure that you have installed GEDLIB with the option `--lib <indentifier>,<UserNodeID>,<UserNodeLabel>,<UserEdgeLabel>`. Subsequently, carry out the folowing steps:

- Add the directory `<GEDLIB_ROOT>/lib` to your link directories.
- Link your application against the shared library `lib<indentifier>gedlib.so`.

## 5. Using GEDLIB

### 5.1 General Usage

In your source file, include the header `src/env/ged_env.hpp` and create your environment object:

```cpp
#include "src/env/ged_env.hpp"
ged::GEDEnv<UserNodeID, UserNodeLabel, UserEdgeLabel> env;
```

All functionality of GEDLIB is accessible via the environment class `ged::GEDEnv`, whose template parameters `UserNodeID`, `UserNodeLabel`, and `UserEdgeLabel` must be set to the types of the node IDs, the node labels, and the edge labels of your graphs. Use the member functions `ged::GEDEnv::add_graph()`, `ged::GEDEnv::add_node()`, and `ged::GEDEnv::add_edge()`, and `ged::GEDEnv::set_edit_costs()` for adding graphs and edit costs to the environment. Once you're done with this, call `ged::GEDEnv::init()` to initialize the environment.

When you have initialized the environment, you are ready to run the GED methods. To select the method, call `ged::GEDEnv::set_method()`. You can then initialize the selected method via `ged::GEDEnv::init_method()`, and run it via `ged::GEDEnv::run_method()`. Note that most method can be run also without initialization, but doing so typically has a negative impact on both runtime and accuracy. Use the member functions `ged::GEDEnv::get_lower_bound()`, `ged::GEDEnv::get_upper_bound()`, `ged::GEDEnv::get_node_map()`, `ged::GEDEnv::get_runtime()`, `ged::GEDEnv::get_init_time()`, `ged::GEDEnv::get_graph_class()`, and `ged::GEDEnv::get_graph_name()` for accessing the results of your GED computations. Use `ged::GEDEnv::quasimetric_costs()` to check if your edit costs are quasimetric on the graphs contained in your environment.
    
### 5.2 Additional Functionality for Graphs Given as GXL Files
    
If you use GEDLIB with the template parameter `UserNodeID` set to `ged::GXLNodeID` a.k.a. `std::string` and the template parameters `UserNodeLabel` and `UserEdgeLabel` set to `ged::GXLLabel` a.k.a. `std::map<std::string,std::string>`, GEDLIB offers additional functionality for loading graphs given in the GXL file format. For those graphs, you do not have to use the member functions `ged::GEDEnv::add_graph()`, `ged::GEDEnv::add_node()`, and `ged::GEDEnv::add_edge()` for adding graphs to your environment. Instead, you can simply load all of them at once by one call to `ged::GEDEnv::load_gxl_graphs()`.

### 5.3 Using GEDLIB as a Shared Library

#### 5.3.1 Graphs Given as GXL Files

If you want to use GEDLIB as a shared library for graphs given as GXL files, make sure that you have installed GEDLIB with the option `--lib gxl`. In your source file, you have to define `GXL_GEDLIB_SHARED` before including `src/env/ged_env.hpp`:

```cpp
  #define GXL_GEDLIB_SHARED  
  #include "src/env/ged_env.hpp"  
  ged::GEDEnv<ged::GXLNodeID, ged::GXLLabel, ged::GXLLabel> env  
  // ...
```

#### 5.3.2 Graphs with User-Defined Node ID, Node Label, and Edge Label Types
  
If you want to use GEDLIB as a shared library for graphs with custom node ID, node label, and edge label types, make sure that you have installed GEDLIB with the option `--lib <indentifier>,<UserNodeID>,<UserNodeLabel>,<UserEdgeLabel>`. In your source file, you have to define `<IDENTIFIER>_GEDLIB_SHARED` before including `src/env/ged_env.hpp`, where `<IDENTIFIER>` is the upper case transformation of `<identifier>`. For example, if you have installed GEDLIB by executing `$ python install.py --lib mytypes,int,double,double`, you have to do the following:

```cpp
  #define MYTYPES_GEDLIB_SHARED  
  #include "src/env/ged_env.hpp"  
  ged::GEDEnv<int, double, double> env  
  // ...
```

### 5.4 Examples

For exacmples of how to use GEDLIB, have a look at `median/src/median_letter.cpp` and at the `.cpp` files contained in the subdirectories of `tests/`.

# 7. Datasets

GEDLIB comes with several datassets which contain graphs given in the [GXL file format](http://www.gupro.de/GXL/index.html). They are contained in the following subdirectories of the directory `data/datasets/`:

- <b>`AIDS`, `Fingerprint`, `GREC`, `Letter`, `Mutagenicity`, `Protein`:</b> These datasets are taken from the [IAM Graph Database](http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/databases/iam-graph-database). 
  You can use them for scientific work, but are requested to include the following reference to your paper:
    - K. Riesen, H. Bunke:
      &ldquo;IAM graph database repository for graph based pattern recognition and machine learning&rdquo;,
      [https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-89689-0\_33](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-89689-0_33)
- <b>`CMU-GED`:</b> This datasets is taken from the [Graph Data Repository for Graph Edit Distance](http://www.rfai.li.univ-tours.fr/PublicData/GDR4GED/home.html). 
  You can use it for scientific work, but are requested to include the following reference to your paper:
    - Z. Abu-Aisheh, R. Raveaux, J.-Y. Ramel:
      &ldquo;A graph database repository and performance evaluation metrics for graph edit distance&rdquo;,
      [https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-18224-7\_14](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-18224-7_14)
- <b>`acyclic`, `alkane`, `mao`, `pah`:</b> These datasets are taken from [GREYC's Chemistry Dataset](https://brunl01.users.greyc.fr/CHEMISTRY/).
- <b> `S-MOL`:</b> Synthetically generated graphs with varying number of node labels whose structure is similar to the structure of `pah` graphs. 

For each dataset, the directory `data/collections/` contains an XML file which lists the contained graphs' GXL files along with their classes. These files match the document type definition `data/collections/GraphCollection.dtd` and can hence be used as input for `ged::GEDEnv::load_gxl_graphs()`. The Python script `data/collections/sample.py` can be used to generate samples of the datasets.
